matrix heatmap offers a good way to inspect the relationships between pairs of topics. Each row and column corresponds to a particular topic, and the color of each cell reflects the degree of semantic similarity between those two topics. Darker cells along the diagonal indicate higher self-similarity (a topic compared to itself), while off-diagonal cells reveal how related (or unrelated) different topics are.\n\nFrom the heatmap, you can see which topics tend to cluster together. Topics that share conceptual ground, such as “Supervised Learning” and “Unsupervised Learning”, appear in regions of higher similarity, suggesting that the language used to describe them overlaps significantly. Conversely, less closely related topics (e.g., “Weather & Climate Prediction” vs. “Audio, Speech & Music Synthesis”) have lower similarity scores, appearing in lighter-colored
