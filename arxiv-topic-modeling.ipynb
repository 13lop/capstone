Topics that are closer together are semantically more similar. \n\nThe map allows for interactive exploration. Upon hovering over the circles, the topic names and sizes are shown. Any area can be selected to zoom in for closer inspection. The size of each circle corresponds to the topic's prevalence in the dataset, making it easy to identify dominant themes.\n\nThis visualization provides a clear and intuitive clustering of topics. For instance, Topic 24, labeled \"Large Language Models (LLMs),\" is positioned near Topic 25, labeled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\" This proximity aligns with expectations, as RAG is a commonly used technique for enhancing LLMs with external knowledge from documents.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"topics.custom_labels_ =

matrix heatmap offers a good way to inspect the relationships between pairs of topics. Each row and column corresponds to a particular topic, and the color of each cell reflects the degree of semantic similarity between those two topics. Darker cells along the diagonal indicate higher self-similarity (a topic compared to itself), while off-diagonal cells reveal how related (or unrelated) different topics are.\n\nFrom the heatmap, you can see which topics tend to cluster together. Topics that share conceptual ground, such as “Supervised Learning” and “Unsupervised Learning”, appear in regions of higher similarity, suggesting that the language used to describe them overlaps significantly. Conversely, less closely related topics (e.g., “Quantum Computing” vs. “Audio, Speech & Music Synthesis”) have lower similarity scores, appearing in lighter-colored
